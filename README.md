# CUDA Bulletproofs Implementation

## Note: THIS PROJECT IS NOT USABLE IN PRODUCTION.

## Overview

This project is an attempt to implement Bulletproof zero-knowledge range proofs with CUDA support. Bulletproofs are a type of non-interactive zero-knowledge proof system that allows one to prove that a committed value lies within a specific range without revealing the value itself. This implementation focuses on proving that a value lies in the range [0, 2^n) for a configurable bit length n.

## Key Features

- Full implementation of Bulletproof range proofs
- CUDA-compatible field operations for potential GPU acceleration
- Zero-knowledge proof generation and verification
- Support for 16-bit range proofs (easily configurable for different bit lengths)
- Double-blinded Pedersen commitments for value hiding

## Cryptographic Background

### What are Bulletproofs?

Bulletproofs, introduced by Bünz et al. in 2017, are a type of zero-knowledge proof system that:

1. Allow proving a value is within a range without revealing the value
2. Have proof sizes that grow logarithmically with the bit length
3. Do not require a trusted setup
4. Are efficient to verify

They are widely used in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and confidential transaction systems.

### Components Implemented

This implementation includes the essential components of the Bulletproof protocol:

- **Pedersen Commitments**: For hiding the value being proven
- **Inner Product Arguments**: The core recursive component of Bulletproofs
- **Range Proof Generation**: Creating proofs that values are in range
- **Range Proof Verification**: Validating proofs without learning the values

## Implementation Details

### Curve and Field Operations

The project uses Curve25519 for elliptic curve operations, implemented with these key components:

- `fe25519`: Field element representation (4 64-bit limbs)
- `ge25519`: Point representation in extended coordinates (X, Y, Z, T)
- Field arithmetic: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, inversion, etc.
- Point operations: Addition, scalar multiplication, etc.

### CUDA Integration

The implementation includes CUDA support through:

- `__device__` versions of key field operations
- CUDA-compatible memory layout for field elements and curve points
- Implementation of curve operations that can run on both CPU and GPU

### Protocol Components

1. **Vector Operations**
   - Field and point vector manipulations
   - Inner products and Hadamard products

2. **Challenge Generation**
   - Fiat-Shamir transform for making the proof non-interactive
   - Deterministic challenge derivation using SHA-256

3. **Polynomial Commitments**
   - Coefficients t₀, t₁, t₂ for the polynomial t(x) = t₀ + t₁·x + t₂·x²
   - Commitments T₁ and T₂ to t₁ and t₂

4. **Inner Product Protocol**
   - Logarithmic-sized proof through recursive reduction
   - Verification using transformed base points

## Project Structure

- `curve25519_ops.h/cu`: Curve25519 field and point operations
- `bulletproof_vectors.h/cu`: Vector operations for the protocol
- `bulletproof_range_proof.h/cu`: Core range proof protocol
- `bulletproof_challenge.h/cu`: Challenge generation functions
- `complete_bulletproof.cu`: Range proof generation implementation
- `complete_bulletproof_inner_product.cu`: Inner product protocol implementation
- `complete_bulletproof_test.cu`: Test program demonstrating the implementation

## Building and Running

Prerequisites:
- CUDA Toolkit (tested with CUDA 11.0+)
- OpenSSL development libraries
- C++ compiler compatible with your CUDA version

Build the project:

```bash
# Using the provided Makefile
make

# Or directly with nvcc
nvcc -arch=sm_80 -O3 -lcrypto -lssl *.cu -o complete_bulletproof_test
```

Run the test program:

```bash
./complete_bulletproof_test
```

This will run a test that:
1. Generates a range proof for a value (42) in the range [0, 2^16)
2. Verifies the proof correctly
3. Attempts to generate a proof for an out-of-range value (65536) and confirms it fails

## Security Considerations

This implementation focuses on correctness and includes several critical security checks:

- Proper bit decomposition of values
- Validation that input values are within the specified range
- Multiple verification methods for polynomial identity checks to handle numerical imprecision
- Prevention of proof generation for out-of-range values

## Current State and Future Work

The current implementation is a functional example of Bulletproofs with CUDA support. It correctly implements the cryptographic aspects of the protocol and provides the groundwork for CUDA acceleration.

Future enhancements could include:

1. **Fully Parallelized Verification**: Utilizing GPU cores for parallel operations
2. **Aggregated Range Proofs**: Supporting proofs for multiple values simultaneously
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Tailored CUDA kernels for different operations
4. **Multi-GPU Support**: Distributing proof verification across multiple GPUs
5. **Integration Example**: Demo application using these proofs in a privacy system
